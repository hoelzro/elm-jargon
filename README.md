# Elm Jargon File

This is a repository for tracking the jargon used by the Elm community.

# Constructor

Used to indicate one of the "branches" of a data type.  For example, the
`Maybe` type looks like this:

```elm
data Maybe a = Just a | Nothing
```

`Just` and `Nothing` are *constructors* for the ''Maybe'' type.
